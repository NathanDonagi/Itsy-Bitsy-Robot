Arduino path following code for a robot I made. You can specify paths in the path.cpp file. I was working with a 20-dollar kit with encoders so terrible that any odometry relying on them would be doomed to inaccuracy. It took weeks of work, combining data from accelerometers, ultrasonic distance sensors, and a Kalman filter (running on the built mpu6050s built in DMP - Digital Motion Processor) to yield anything resembling accurate tracking.
